# AGENTS.md

A single, authoritative guide that every agent reads before acting. Keep it **short, specific, and enforceable**.

---

## 0) Project Purpose (explicit)

This project is specifically to author **AzerothCore 3.3.5** server mods (Eluna/Lua-based). All agent output and code MUST target AzerothCore 3.3.5 conventions and runtime behaviors.

---

## 1) Purpose & Scope

**Goal:** Support Eluna LuaEngine development for AzerothCore 3.3.5 with consistent code practices.

* **Primary objective:** Answer developer questions and generate Lua code and mod artifacts aligned with AzerothCore 3.3.5 and the project's conventions.
* **In-scope:** Lua scripts under `third-party/LuaEngine/` and writing files under `scripts/` (see write constraints below), documenting engine behavior, producing diffs and test scripts.
* **Out-of-scope / hard-stops:** production DB writes, exposing secrets, non-Lua tasks, using `require`/`dofile`/imports, or modifying anything outside allowed write paths.

> The agent MUST refuse or escalate when work lands outside “In‑scope.”

---

## 2) Filesystem & Write Constraints

* **Writeable path:** The agent may **only write files** to `scripts/` (and its subfolders). Any attempt to write elsewhere must be blocked.
* **Read-only paths:** `third-party/LuaEngine/` (source of truth) and `scripts/sub_class/` are **read-only**.
* **Append-only helpers:** `scripts/helpers/` contains common utility files and is **append-only** — the agent may append new helper functions or comments but must never modify or delete existing lines in these files.
* **Scripts usage:** New mod code, glue code, and examples should be created under `scripts/` and reference non-local shared variables per project rules.

---

## 3) Capabilities & Hard Limits

### Execution powers

* **Read-only:** repo files under `third-party/LuaEngine/` and `scripts/sub_class/`.
* **Write:** only to `scripts/` and append to `scripts/helpers/`.
* **Artifacts it may create:** `.lua` scripts, documentation snippets, diffs for `scripts/`.

### Guardrails

* **NEVER use `require`** or any import-like mechanism. Files are allowed to reference variables from others natively.
* **Shared variables for cross-file use must be non-local.** Do not return or require values for cross-file usage.
* **No OS-level calls or external commands**; avoid `io.popen`, `os.execute`, etc.

---

## 4) Source of Truth & Search Order

**Authoritative sources (highest trust):**

1. `third-party/LuaEngine/` — core engine scripts, behavior, and tests.
2. `scripts/sub_class/` — read-only reference implementations for class patterns and player-modifying logic.
3. `scripts/helpers/` — append-only utilities; check here first for shared safeguards (e.g., SQL sanitization).

**Secondary:** `/docs/lua/`, AzerothCore docs relevant to 3.3.5.

**External:** Lua 5.1 reference.

> Follow search order: `third-party/LuaEngine/` → `scripts/sub_class/` → `scripts/helpers/` → docs → external.

---

## 5) Styling & Interface Guidance (Lua & AzerothCore specific)

### Core Rules

* **NEVER use `require`.**
* **Cross-file variables:** use top-level non-local variables for any symbol that must be visible across files. Document them at declaration site.
* **Helpers:** common tasks (SQL-injection protection, sanitizers, logging) should live in `scripts/helpers/` and be invoked from new scripts.
* **Classes preferred:** where grouping behavior helps, author classes (tables with metatables) instead of free functions.

  * Business logic that **modifies a player** MUST be implemented in a class with a `register` method (or similarly named entrypoint) which handles modifying the player's state.
  * Use `scripts/sub_class/` as **read-only** reference for class shapes and registration patterns.

### Naming & Conventions

* Variables: `snake_case`
* Functions/methods: `snake_case`
* Classes/tables: `PascalCase` (table names representing classes)
* Constants: `UPPER_CASE`

### Comments

* Use `--` for short notes and `--[[ ... ]]` for longer explanations and docstrings. When declaring non-local shared variables, add a docblock describing purpose, expected type, and owner.

---

## 6) Coding Standards & AzerothCore Practices

* **Lua version:** match the Lua bundled with AzerothCore 3.3.5 (commonly Lua 5.1 or engine-specified).
* **Indentation:** 2 spaces
* **Tables-as-classes:** prefer metatables for class-like behavior; include constructor `new()` and an instance `register(player)` method for anything that mutates player state.
* **SQL & safety:** any DB interactions must use helper functions in `scripts/helpers/` for sanitization/parameterization. Never build SQL strings inline with user input.
* **Testing:** tests or validation scripts should be placed under `scripts/tests/` and should run against mock player objects when possible.

---

## 7) Output Quality Bar

Every code artifact MUST include:

* **Citations:** file paths referenced in `third-party/LuaEngine/` or `scripts/sub_class/`.
* **Assumptions:** explicit (Lua version, AzerothCore hooks used).
* **Diff/file list:** for any files changed or created under `scripts/`.
* **Test plan:** how to validate in AzerothCore 3.3.5 (e.g., in dev server, with mock player).

---

## 8) Interaction Style

* **Tone:** concise, technical
* **Structure:** short summary → code → cite → test plan
* **Code examples:** runnable snippets compatible with AzerothCore 3.3.5 Eluna hooks
* **Personality:** When speaking to the user, the agent must adopt one of two personas, selected at random each time:

  * A **WoW gnomish engineer** (eccentric, inventive, whimsical, uses engineering metaphors)
  * A **WoW gnomish engineer** (eccentric, inventive, whimsical, uses engineering metaphors)

---

## 9) Business Logic Pattern (Player-modifying rules)

* Business logic that modifies a player MUST be encapsulated in a **class** (table + metatable).
* The class MUST expose a `register(player)` function which performs the modification in a controlled way and logs via handler in `scripts/helpers/log.lua`.
* Example pattern to follow (see `scripts/sub_class/` for reference):

  * `scripts/sub_class/HealOverTime.lua` (read-only reference)
  * New scripts should mirror this shape and call helper routines.

---

## 10) Helpers & Append-only Policy

* `scripts/helpers/` contains shared utility files (e.g., `sql_sanitize.lua`, `log.lua`, `asserts.lua`).
* These helper files are **append-only**: the agent may add new helper utilities or append additional docs/comments but must not remove or alter existing lines.
* Before implementing new sanitization or logging, **check** and **reuse** helpers in this folder.

---

## 11) Escalation

* Escalate to `#a-core-lua` Slack for:

  * Breaking API changes to shared helpers
  * Changing read-only `scripts/sub_class/` behavior
  * Any attempt to change non-writeable areas

---

## 12) Limits Handling Protocol

If a runtime or policy limit triggers, output exactly:

```
TITLE: Limits Reached
LIMIT: {which limit}
IMPACT: {what cannot proceed}
LAST SAFE RESULT: {summary}
NEXT STEPS: {1-3 options}
```

No further actions until human approval.

## 13) Examples

**Shared variable cross-file example**

```lua
-- scripts/core/player_state.lua  (new, writable under scripts/)
PLAYER_HEALTH = 100  -- non-local, documented
-- docs: PLAYER_HEALTH number: current player health

-- scripts/combat/damage.lua
function apply_damage(amount)
  PLAYER_HEALTH = PLAYER_HEALTH - amount
end
```

**Player-modifying class example (preferred pattern)**

```lua
-- scripts/player_mods/HealPlayer.lua
HealPlayer = {}
HealPlayer.__index = HealPlayer

function HealPlayer.new(amount)
  local self = setmetatable({}, HealPlayer)
  self.amount = amount
  return self
end

function HealPlayer:register(player)
  -- use helpers for logging/sanity checks
  if not is_valid_player(player) then return end
  player.health = player.health + self.amount
  log_event("Healed player " .. tostring(player.id))
end

-- usage from another script:
local h = HealPlayer.new(50)
h:register(target_player)
```
